# Employee Retention Optimization

## Project Title:
**Predicting Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning Models**

## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify factors contributing to employee attrition. This was achieved through the use of decision tree and random forest classifiers. The final model, a random forest classifier, demonstrated strong performance, with high AUC scores, precision, recall, and accuracy. Key features such as job satisfaction, last evaluation, number of projects, tenure, and workload were identified as significant factors influencing employee retention. This model can be used by HR departments to proactively identify employees at risk of leaving and take necessary steps to improve retention.

## Business Understanding:
Employee attrition is a significant concern for businesses, as it leads to increased hiring costs and decreased productivity. HR teams need an efficient way to predict which employees are at risk of leaving so that interventions can be made to retain them. By building a robust machine learning model, the company can focus on high-risk employees and address their concerns in a timely manner, thus reducing attrition rates and improving workforce stability.

## Data Understanding:
The dataset used in this project contains information about employees from an HR department, including features such as job satisfaction, number of projects, monthly working hours, tenure, department, salary, and whether the employee left the company. The dataset consists of 15 columns and approximately 10,000 rows. There were some missing values that were handled appropriately, and categorical features like department and salary were encoded to numerical values for model compatibility. Feature engineering was also performed to improve model accuracy, such as creating new features based on tenure and job satisfaction.

## Modeling and Evaluation:
A decision tree and random forest classifier were evaluated, with the random forest model ultimately being selected as the champion model. The random forest model performed better in terms of AUC, precision, and recall, demonstrating its ability to identify employees at risk of leaving. The model’s evaluation metrics on the test data included:

- **Precision**: 87.0%
- **Recall**: 90.4%
- **F1-score**: 88.7%
- **Accuracy**: 96.2%
- **AUC**: 93.8%

Additionally, feature importance plots were generated to identify which variables were most influential in predicting employee attrition. The key features influencing employee attrition were identified as *last_evaluation*, *number_project*, *tenure*, and *overworked*.

A confusion matrix was also generated to visualize the model's performance on the test set. The confusion matrix showed that while there were some false positives (employees incorrectly flagged as at risk), the model’s ability to identify true positives (employees at risk of leaving) was strong.

## Conclusion:
The predictive model successfully identified key factors influencing employee attrition, with high performance on both precision and recall metrics. The most influential features for predicting attrition were related to workload, job satisfaction, and tenure. Based on the model, HR departments can focus on addressing employee workload, ensuring fair recognition for employees with longer tenures, and creating a clearer work-life balance for overworked employees.

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Data Leakage Check**: Consider testing the model without the *last_evaluation* feature to ensure there is no data leakage.
2. **Model Refinement**: Experiment with other models such as Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks to see if they outperform the current random forest model.
3. **Feature Exploration**: Investigate other potential features such as the *satisfaction* score or external data on industry trends.
4. **K-Means Clustering**: Consider applying clustering algorithms to group employees into segments and analyze each segment’s risk of attrition.
5. **NLP Application**: Explore the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) on employee feedback or performance reviews to add valuable insights to the model.
